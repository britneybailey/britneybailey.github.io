      <description>About the data In my project, I have chosen to include two datasets, which I will refer to as cdc and hospital. The cdc dataset contains information from the CDC on mortality in different cities/counties in the US. Some of the variables in the cdc dataset include number of deaths, death rates compared to the national rate, population size of the county, and crude mortality rates.
The hospital dataset is sourced from the medicare website, where the government makes data available regarding patients in different cities/counties.</description>

(5 pts) Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations?  For project 2, I will be looking at The Microbe Directory. The goal of The Microbe Directory is to compile information categorizing over 7,000 microorganisms.</description>
